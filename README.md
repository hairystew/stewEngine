Stewengine is a very rudamentary graphics engine using C++ and the Vulkan API. This project was really never intended to be used other than by myself. This was mainly a means to learning graphics programming, C++, and working on larger programming projects! Here is a little video of the engine using Simplex Noise to render voxels!
